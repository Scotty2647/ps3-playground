# PS3 Playground
A collection of PS3 tools and experiments using WebKit, Flash, and other options.

We are only testing on firmware 4.81 at the moment.
=
All hardware revisions will be supported [A0x-P0x/2xxx/3xxx/4xxx] on OFW/CFW 4.81


THIS REPO IS FOR THE PUBLIC PS3 COMMUNITY TO EXPLORE AND TEST ON THEIR OWN

OUR TEAM IS CURRENTLY WORKING ON THIS PROJECT PRIVATELY AND WILL UPDATE WHEN FINISHED!

FOR A LIVE DEMO WITH PUBLIC TESTS TO TRY OUT, PLEASE VISIT: http://www.websploit.org/ps3/ps3-playground/test/


There are a lot of files here for reference and exploration.

Once more testing has been done, these will be cleaned up over time.
