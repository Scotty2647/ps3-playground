The flash-plugin package contains a Mozilla Firefox compatible Adobe Flash
Player web browser plug-in.

This update fixes two vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash Player. These
vulnerabilities are detailed on the Adobe security page APSB12-05, listed
in the References section.

A flaw was found in the way flash-plugin displayed certain SWF content. An
attacker could use this flaw to create a specially-crafted SWF file that
would cause flash-plugin to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code
when the victim loaded a page containing the specially-crafted SWF content.
(CVE-2012-0768)

A flaw in flash-plugin could allow an attacker to obtain sensitive
information if a victim were tricked into visiting a specially-crafted web
page. (CVE-2012-0769)

All users of Adobe Flash Player should install this updated package, which
upgrades Flash Player to version 10.3.183.16.
