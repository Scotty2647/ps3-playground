3. Description:

The flash-plugin package contains a Mozilla Firefox compatible Adobe Flash
Player web browser plug-in.

This update fixes several vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash Player. These
vulnerabilities are detailed on the Adobe security page APSB12-14, listed
in the References section.

Several security flaws were found in the way flash-plugin displayed certain
SWF content. An attacker could use these flaws to create a
specially-crafted SWF file that would cause flash-plugin to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code when the victim loaded a page
containing the specially-crafted SWF content. (CVE-2012-2034,
CVE-2012-2035, CVE-2012-2036, CVE-2012-2037, CVE-2012-2039)

A flaw in flash-plugin could allow an attacker to obtain sensitive
information if a victim were tricked into visiting a specially-crafted web
page. (CVE-2012-2038)

All users of Adobe Flash Player should install this updated package, which
upgrades Flash Player to version 10.3.183.20.
