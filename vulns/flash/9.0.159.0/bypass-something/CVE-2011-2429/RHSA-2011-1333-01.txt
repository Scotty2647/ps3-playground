3. Description:

The flash-plugin package contains a Mozilla Firefox compatible Adobe Flash
Player web browser plug-in.

This update fixes multiple vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash Player. These
vulnerabilities are detailed on the Adobe security page APSB11-26, listed
in the References section.

Multiple security flaws were found in the way flash-plugin displayed
certain SWF content. An attacker could use these flaws to create a
specially-crafted SWF file that would cause flash-plugin to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code when the victim loaded a page
containing the specially-crafted SWF content. (CVE-2011-2426,
CVE-2011-2427, CVE-2011-2428, CVE-2011-2430)

A flaw in flash-plugin could allow an attacker to conduct cross-site
scripting (XSS) attacks if a victim were tricked into visiting a
specially-crafted web page. (CVE-2011-2444)

This update also fixes an information disclosure flaw in flash-plugin.
(CVE-2011-2429)

All users of Adobe Flash Player should install this updated package, which
upgrades Flash Player to version 10.3.183.10.
