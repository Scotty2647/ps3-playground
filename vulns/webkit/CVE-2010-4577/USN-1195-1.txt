Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1195-1
August 23, 2011

webkit vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 10.10
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

Multiple security vulnerabilities were fixed in WebKit.

Software Description:
- webkit: Web content engine library for GTK+

Details:

A large number of security issues were discovered in the WebKit browser and
JavaScript engines. If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious
website, a remote attacker could exploit a variety of issues related to web
browser security, including cross-site scripting attacks, denial of
service attacks, and arbitrary code execution.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 10.10:
  libwebkit-1.0-2                 1.2.7-0ubuntu0.10.10.1

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  libwebkit-1.0-2                 1.2.7-0ubuntu0.10.04.1

After a standard system update you need to restart any applications that
use WebKit, such as Epiphany and Midori, to make all the necessary changes.
